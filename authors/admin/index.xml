      <description>I am a visiting scholar at UC Merced, supervised by Prof. Ming-Hsuan Yang. My research interests include computer vision and deep learning.
I decided to switch field from Economics/Finance to Computer Science due to my past experiences in this field. Taking several CS and ML courses at UC Berkeley and NTU piqued my interest in CS. And my past research experiences as a research assistant at VSLab, NTHU and an intern at an AI startup, RelaJet made me determine to do advanced studies in CS.</description>
